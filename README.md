# Customer Support AI Agent

This is a simple Customer Support AI Agent designed to answer common e-commerce questions using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. The agent retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base (product descriptions and company policies) and generates accurate, context-aware responses using OpenAI's LLM. It also includes memory for each session to maintain conversational context.

## Approach

1. **Knowledge Base**:
   - The agent uses two text files (`products.txt` and `policies.txt`) as its knowledge base.
   - These files contain product details (e.g., price, features, availability) and company policies (e.g., shipping, returns).

2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:
   - The agent uses ChromaDB for vector storage to efficiently retrieve relevant information from the knowledge base.
   - OpenAI's LLM generates responses based on the retrieved context.

3. **Memory**:
   - The agent uses `ConversationBufferMemory` to remember the conversation history within a session.
   - This allows the agent to handle follow-up questions and maintain context.

4. **Command-Line Interface**:
   - The agent is accessible via a simple command-line interface (CLI).

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Python**:
   - Ensure Python 3.8 or later is installed on your system.

3. **Install Requirements**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
4. **Setup OpenAI Key in .env File**
